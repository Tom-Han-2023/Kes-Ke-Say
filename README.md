# Kes-Ke-Say

This project was a teacher led project held over 3 days, where 6 sets of pairs contributed to functionality 
inside an app that was scoped and designed by our facilitators.

Kes-Ke-Say is a social sharing platform where user can create posts, read posts made by other users and have access to latest French News and weather
